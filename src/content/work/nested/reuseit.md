## From B2B to B2C

> Sustainability is the key to our survival on this planet

The aim of reuse-it is to provide a source of affordable pre-owned but technically perfect smart devices.
However the jump from B2B to B2C requires different approaches when it comes to E-Commerce. 

### It's about the customer, not the company

In the past years, the way brands interact with customers has changed. It is not anymore about showing "how great and amazing" your brand is, but more about making the customer feel valuable. The approach of reuse-it is to provide different "tiers" when buying a product. From "Umweltfreund" to "Umweltheld", products get verified with badges to make it clear how sustainable they are. The feeling of actually having an impact in the modern worlds sustainability chain can be good way to make a decision where to buy a product and where not.
